## 📘 Project Description

This AI Writing Assistant analyzes your input text for tone (positive, negative, or neutral) using basic natural language rules. It also provides writing improvement suggestions like expanding short sentences, adding reasoning, or breaking long paragraphs — making it a helpful tool for better writing.

All logic is handled on the client-side with no third-party APIs or backend required.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Building logic-based AI behavior using plain JavaScript
- Using React's `useState` for form and state handling
- Creating a suggestion engine with simple heuristics
- Responsive UI design using Tailwind CSS
- Handling conditional rendering in React
